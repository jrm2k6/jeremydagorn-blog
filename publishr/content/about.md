###My name is **Jeremy Dagorn.** ###
I am currently working at [Prezi](http://www.prezi.com) as a software engineer, as part of the Javascript UI team.
I love to learn, write code, write prose, criminology, startups and too many other stuff to fit 
on this page.

Before Prezi, I did some internships in France, and in the USA (UC Santa Cruz). I like to travel,
that's why I lived in France, USA, Canada, and Hungary.
I love to learn new languages, and I have a<span class="love"> *secret* love </span> for functional programming, even if I am still a beginner.

You can find here my formal resume.
