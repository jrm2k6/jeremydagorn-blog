###My name is **Jeremy Dagorn.** ###
I am currently working at [PocketDerm](https://www.pocketderm.com) as a full-stack software engineer.
I love to learn, write code, write prose, criminology, startups and too many other stuff to fit 
on this page.

Before working at PocketDerm, I was a software engineer at [Prezi](http://www.prezi.com) for more than 2 years, living in Budapest, Hungary. I did some internships in France, and in the USA (UC Santa Cruz). I like to travel,
that's why I lived in France, USA, Canada, and Hungary.
I love to learn new languages, and I have a<span class="love"> *secret* love </span> for functional programming, even if I am still a beginner.
